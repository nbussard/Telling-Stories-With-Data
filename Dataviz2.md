# Data Visualization 2 

# Original 

This original graph is overwhelming. When I look at it, my eyes are not sure what is important and what it is actually trying to say. Looking at the information and what it was attempting to say, I came to the conclusion that it was not necessary to include all of the instituions as they as far too many boxes for the eye to follow. Additionally, you can show the drastic difference in awards being given by only showing a select few instituions and excluding the percentage of the whole. It would be better to show the percentage in its own graph and maybe only sector. In Critiquing this graph, I felt it was good to see it on a spectrum anf be able to give a number value to it but as a more qualitative person, explaining the failure of the graph in words is easier.

# Wireframe

I began my wireframe by thinking of how to elimiate unnecessary information. This began by decidng to cut down the instituions to the top 10. By doing so it allows me to show those who are putting out the most degress but also the dissonance between them. Then I had to decided on how to show the 10 institutions. I went with a bar graph. Lastly, I had to decide the details of that bar graph. I took the number of degrees as the y-axis, and the institutions as the x-axis. I gave a new title to better explain the graph. My color scheme would use contrasting colors to show the difference between public and private and then different shades in those color to show 2 or 4 year schools.

# Critique

My critiques were mainly positive. My original title involved the words "top 10" and I was encouraged to change that as it inferred to the normal ranking system of schools instead of just showing the amount of degrees awarded. They also said that the wording of my title was focus on the institutions as the subject when they thought it should be the amounf of degrees awarded. Also they said it may be better to expand it to 20 so that it shows a little more of the information. Lastly, they said I should switch the x and y axis. 

# New Graph

This graph is alot cleaner. It still shows how the Institute of Chicago drastically awards more degrees and also shows which sector is giving out more degrees. While it does, eliminate some of the sectors. This graph shows the difference beteen the top 20 and how from 1 to 20 there is a large drop. I also capped the x-axis. Even though Chicago is far abve 600, it wouldn't show the other schools in comparison well if it wasn't capped. Overall, I think this graph is a far better representation of information and could be expanded to show more institutuions if necesssary. With the 20 you also begin to see how the distance between each school shrinks and begins to level out. Overall, it shows that many of the school awarding degrees are public 4 year institutions but the most is a private non- profi, which speaks to the elitism of the art world.
