# Final Project Part 2 

# Storyboard

These photos are the visual path of my story. It outlines the introduction of the concept, the presentation of each section of data, the comparison of the data, and lastly, the conclusions and call to action.

# Wire Frame

For my wireframe I developed draft versions of my visuals in Tableau. These drafts were presented in combination with the storyboard into to provide my reviewers with a holsitic picture of the story.

# User Protocol

Target Audience

The target audience of this story is the individuals in both education and in arts institutions. As the future of the industry is bound by the standard that education is important and the institutions that hire individuals that come from education, both of these parties will be the focus of this story. The aim is to show those working in the education setting that the individuals that accepts are those who are entering the work force and how they can enact change by having better acceptance policies and reaching out to broader audiences. Those in the art institutions hire those coming from the education system. While the current standard perpetuate hiring out of those that apply and the pool of applicants is only so large, this story should show that by focusing on equitable hiring and making sure their opportunities are posted in the proper places that can increase the flow of diverse applicants by representing as many voice as possible.

Idenifying Individuals

 I will look for three individuals. The first will be someone in the education sector who sees the students coming into arts programs. The second will be someone who sits in the art institution sector and handles in coming artists and employees. Lastly, I will interview a artist who has been in both sectors as well as being an individual represented in the data 

# Interview Script 

Introduction: I am looking at the correlation between current industry demographics of race and gender and that of education in order to understand how the two have grown and the impact that the education funnel has on the industry. The following sketches show both the draft graphs and the draft story of the information. I am going to show you each and ask you some questions

Show them the graphs and storyboard for answering the following questions. 

Q1: Does the progression of the story and the story itself reach my intended goal described before? 

Q2: What was unclear in the story? 

Q3: What did you think was best? 

Q4: What do you think needs improved? 

Q5: Do these draft grafts relay the proper information to tell the story?

Q6: What is unclear in these graphs?

Q7: What is best?

Q8:  What improvements need to be made?

Q9: Do they graphs and story communicate together?

Q10: If so, why? If not, what is the disconnect and how do you think it can be fixed?

# Changes Implemented 

1) I made sure to get all of my colors the same and fix any axis issues. 

2) I reevaluated my storyboard and made sure I knew what I would say in the final project.

3) Make sure to address any missing data info such asonly binary gender options, and not fully representative race information

4) Give white demographic a color and the others a gray scale to emphasis the disparity

5) Make sure final conclusions are not over assuming

6) Make sure to define arts

7) Define degrees in initial introduction

8)Make data labels consistent

9) Make order of labels consistent
