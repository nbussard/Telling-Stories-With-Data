# Final Project 

# How Equitable Has Art Higher Education Become?

# Outline

This project will examine the current Arts Higher Education demographics of gender and race in relation to the current industry  demographics of gender and race between 2014 and 2016 to see if the trends in inclusion and equity are having impact and how it should impact the future.

The story arc with this will open with addressing the current industry and how the demographics have changed as well as been impacted by the education demographics. This drop to the past will then ask the question on how does the arts higher education demographics influence the industry and begin to rise as it shows the current education dempgrpahics and thier change over time. It climax by showing the education demographics in comparison to the industry. Lastly, it will end in a questioning call to action to how this aid in the growth of the industry and reach the a better equity than exists.

Exact Outline would be as follows: 

Title & Subheading

Introduction about gender and race in artists, how industry is challenging lack of diversity, Education can change industry

Graph 1 current state of artists in terms of gender
Graph 2 current start in terms of race

Commentary about how these graph shows the current state of artists

Graph 6 Current state of race in bachelors degree

Commentary in similarty/difference from the current industry

Graph 7 change in gender over the years in bachelor and master degree
Graph 8 change in race over the years in bachelor and master degree

Commentary on comparison to industry, % change, and whether it is increasing

Graph 9/10 compariosn of % change in gender in industry to education and comparison in composistion
Graph 11/12 compariosn of % change race in industry to education and comparison in composistion

Protential Visual for a final comparison of  if it continues growing at the average rate, where it will be in 5 years

Final remarks on how to improve this/Call to action

# The Data 

All the data was pulled from data sets by DATAUSA. It is involves data from a few different data sets as to provide a full picture. For the education portion of this project, I am using data from the Visual and Performing Arts Education page (https://datausa.io/profile/cip/visual-performing-arts#demographics). I am focusing on three graphs: Gender Imbalance for Common Institutions (https://datausa.io/profile/cip/visual-performing-arts#enrolled_gender), the Race and Diversity by Degrees Awarded (https://datausa.io/profile/cip/visual-performing-arts#ethnicity_degrees), and Race & Ethnicity by Gender (https://datausa.io/profile/cip/visual-performing-arts#grads_ethnicity_gender). For the industry, the data sets came from the Artists & Related Workers Page (https://datausa.io/profile/soc/artists-related-workers). There are two data sets used from this page: Gender Composition (https://datausa.io/profile/soc/artists-related-workers#gender) and Race & Ethnicity (https://datausa.io/profile/soc/artists-related-workers#ethnicity). 

I plan to take this data and use it in several ways. As the data has many years with it, I will show the current snap shot of both race and gender in education and the industry. While Datausa does this already, the industry could use color alteration and a focus on only the USA race data instead of comparing the USA to the globe. The education data needs more work. I need to take the gender information and bring it together. It is currently spread among each university and since the industry shows the industry as a whole, I need to remove the university seperation. I will also alter the colors and the potential structure to better show the time dimension that is central to this story. Lastly, depending on what the data says, I would like to show the potential change in the industry based on % growth that have been occuring.

By taking the most current data as a snap shot and then showing the change over time it will artuculate how effective the social innitiatives to create a mire equitable arts higher education environment as well as an arts industry have been. The data should show if the funnel of education is impactful on the changes of the industry and if education inititaitve needs to imporve and potentially how. While there are many others factors involved in this story such as admissions polcies, inclusion policies, the systemic issues involved in both education and the art world, my goals is to simply show is there has been any effect to the demographics from the initiatives and policies both parties have been focusing on, 

# Method and Medium 

For this project, I plan on creating my story in Shorthand. I plan to simply a few graphs and make as little statements as possible in the 60 seconds. My graphs will be made  to show the imformation with as little words and reading as possibe. My goal for completing my project has a few stages. First, I will analyze the data and then begin to visualize it. After that I plan to draft my story. Then, I want to get feedback to make sure the story is understandable and that it portrays the information I thought it would. Lastly, I will make any changes and refine the story to make my final presentation and completed story.
