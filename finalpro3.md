# Final Project Part 3

# Part 1 of Project 

# Outline

This project will examine the current Arts Higher Education demographics of gender and race in relation to the current industry  demographics of gender and race between 2014 and 2016 to see if the trends in inclusion and equity are having impact and how it should impact the future.

The story arc with this will open with addressing the current industry and how the demographics have changed as well as been impacted by the education demographics. This drop to the past will then ask the question on how does the arts higher education demographics influence the industry and begin to rise as it shows the current education dempgrpahics and thier change over time. It climax by showing the education demographics in comparison to the industry. Lastly, it will end in a questioning call to action to how this aid in the growth of the industry and reach the a better equity than exists.

Exact Outline would be as follows:

# The Data 

All the data was pulled from data sets by DATAUSA. It is involves data from a few different data sets as to provide a full picture. For the education portion of this project, I am using data from the Visual and Performing Arts Education page (https://datausa.io/profile/cip/visual-performing-arts#demographics). I am focusing on three graphs: Gender Imbalance for Common Institutions (https://datausa.io/profile/cip/visual-performing-arts#enrolled_gender), the Race and Diversity by Degrees Awarded (https://datausa.io/profile/cip/visual-performing-arts#ethnicity_degrees), and Race & Ethnicity by Gender (https://datausa.io/profile/cip/visual-performing-arts#grads_ethnicity_gender). For the industry, the data sets came from the Artists & Related Workers Page (https://datausa.io/profile/soc/artists-related-workers). There are two data sets used from this page: Gender Composition (https://datausa.io/profile/soc/artists-related-workers#gender) and Race & Ethnicity (https://datausa.io/profile/soc/artists-related-workers#ethnicity). 

I plan to take this data and use it in several ways. As the data has many years with it, I will show the current snap shot of both race and gender in education and the industry. While Datausa does this already, the industry could use color alteration and a focus on only the USA race data instead of comparing the USA to the globe. The education data needs more work. I need to take the gender information and bring it together. It is currently spread among each university and since the industry shows the industry as a whole, I need to remove the university seperation. I will also alter the colors and the potential structure to better show the time dimension that is central to this story. Lastly, depending on what the data says, I would like to show the potential change in the industry based on % growth that have been occuring.

By taking the most current data as a snap shot and then showing the change over time it will artuculate how effective the social innitiatives to create a mire equitable arts higher education environment as well as an arts industry have been. The data should show if the funnel of education is impactful on the changes of the industry and if education inititaitve needs to imporve and potentially how. While there are many others factors involved in this story such as admissions polcies, inclusion policies, the systemic issues involved in both education and the art world, my goals is to simply show is there has been any effect to the demographics from the initiatives and policies both parties have been focusing on, 

# Method and Medium 

For this project, I plan on creating my story in Shorthand. I plan to simply a few graphs and make as little statements as possible in the 60 seconds. My graphs will be made  to show the imformation with as little words and reading as possibe. My goal for completing my project has a few stages. First, I will analyze the data and then begin to visualize it. After that I plan to draft my story. Then, I want to get feedback to make sure the story is understandable and that it portrays the information I thought it would. Lastly, I will make any changes and refine the story to make my final presentation and completed story. 

# Part 2 of Project

# Storyboard

These photos are the visual path of my story. It outlines the introduction of the concept, the presentation of each section of data, the comparison of the data, and lastly, the conclusions and call to action.

# Wire Frame

For my wireframe I developed draft versions of my visuals in Tableau. These drafts were presented in combination with the storyboard into to provide my reviewers with a holsitic picture of the story.

# User Protocol

Target Audience

The target audience of this story is the individuals in both education and in arts institutions. As the future of the industry is bound by the standard that education is important and the institutions that hire individuals that come from education, both of these parties will be the focus of this story. The aim is to show those working in the education setting that the individuals that accepts are those who are entering the work force and how they can enact change by having better acceptance policies and reaching out to broader audiences. Those in the art institutions hire those coming from the education system. While the current standard perpetuate hiring out of those that apply and the pool of applicants is only so large, this story should show that by focusing on equitable hiring and making sure their opportunities are posted in the proper places that can increase the flow of diverse applicants by representing as many voice as possible.

Idenifying Individuals

 I will look for three individuals. The first will be someone in the education sector who sees the students coming into arts programs. The second will be someone who sits in the art institution sector and handles in coming artists and employees. Lastly, I will interview a artist who has been in both sectors as well as being an individual represented in the data 

# Interview Script 

Introduction: I am looking at the correlation between current industry demographics of race and gender and that of education in order to understand how the two have grown and the impact that the education funnel has on the industry. The following sketches show both the draft graphs and the draft story of the information. I am going to show you each and ask you some questions

Show them the graphs and storyboard for answering the following questions. 

Q1: Does the progression of the story and the story itself reach my intended goal described before? 

Q2: What was unclear in the story? 

Q3: What did you think was best? 

Q4: What do you think needs improved? 

Q5: Do these draft grafts relay the proper information to tell the story?

Q6: What is unclear in these graphs?

Q7: What is best?

Q8:  What improvements need to be made?

Q9: Do they graphs and story communicate together?

Q10: If so, why? If not, what is the disconnect and how do you think it can be fixed?

# Final data story

My final audience will be aim at the desicion makers in both hte arts industry, specifically residency and exhibtion programs, and within arts education. While I didn't use personas, the rough ideas I had in mind were as follows: 

Industry: a white woman who is a program manager for a small to medium sized arts organization that is responsible for organzing, selecting, or mediatiing a committee on who is participating in programs. This woman is socially conscience and aims for representation as well as upholding best practices. 

Education: an middle aged white indivdual who is the department head of a program. This individual has an inclusion policy to follow and understands the importance of diverosty but can only use the applicantions that receive from the normal outreach methods. 

I wanted to make the project as linear as possible. I wanted to place less focus on the actual numbers and more on the visual disparity between the demographics. Using this persona ideas, it gave ma a language base to use and that is why I change from a forecast at the end to highlighting the system of arts education and why it is important to be aware of the cyclical impact it all has. 

My goal through this project was it hightlight that education does have an impact on industry and vice versa. It was not to say that education is not impact and that is should not be part of criteria for programs but that it should not be held in high importance. Most importantly, I want this to show that by putting a high focus on education it automatically excludes artists. This is also to bring awareness to the current sistuations, the improvement that have been made and still need to occur. I made sure to highlight the why and the limitations of this imformation. I wanted to keep the palate simple. The well known gender colors, similar colors for race, and easily understandable graphs. 

The biggest learning process was how to portray the thoughts in my head and make sure it ius understandable by others. This meant being direct in my language and make sure my graphs were quickly showing the compostiton. This mean knowing exactly what I wanted a viewer to see when they immediatly looked at the graph.
